Em 1952, o Spirit estava encerrando seu primeiro ciclo de aventuras nas tirinhas dos jornais e, por incrível que possa parecer, Will Eisner estava perdendo o interesse em sua criação. A concorrência com a TV, entre outras coisas, dificultava a viabilidade de manter a publicação e o autor queria levar seu talento para novos ares. Neste período, a tirinha já estava sendo escrita por outra pessoa, Jules Feiffer, e um artista substituto precisava ser encontrado.

Um assunto que estava muito na moda, naquela época, era a idéia do "espaço sideral", com seus discos voadores e luzes brilhantes. Foi assim que Will Eisner levou as aventuras de Denny Colt para um caminho  diferente do usual, mais especificamente, a Lua. O Spirit foi recrutado para vigiar alguns prisioneiros que, por sua vez, haviam sido recrutados  para acompanhar o Professor Skol na viagem de sua nave espacial.

Now who is arguably the finest space opera artist in comics? Wally Wood of course and that's who Eisner tapped to take over the strip during this offbeat new trend in the series. The experiment failed and eventually the Spirit was canceled before the end of the storyline, but some very engaging artwork was created by Wood and Eisner during this period.

Kitchen Sink collected these stories along with the scripts by Jules Feiffer for the unfinished material back in 1989 in one of the most handsome comic volumes I happen to own.

Here's a link to some of the earliest stories in the sequence. And here's a link to another one.

Here are the very dramatic splash pages to the original Spirit stories. In the third story " A DP on the Moon", the dictator was originally written by Jules Feiffer to be Hitler. Wally Wood apparently drew it that way, but Eisner changed it to a fictional South American dictator. He thought there were too many Hitler-is-still-alive stories at the time. It's too bad as that really undermines the effectiveness of the story.

And here are a trio of covers done by Will Eisner for regular Kitchen Sink comic reprints of these stories.
